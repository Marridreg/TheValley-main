    take effect by widening the narrator's card in get_narrator_card, and their
    names carry GM-side metadata. The section label is a spoiler in itself
    (`dragon_nature`), and the #rumor tag would tell the narrator a released fact
    is unreliable in exactly the case the design wants the rumour played as fact.

    So the match is anchored to the documented key format rather than sniffed.
    The looser tests are wrong in both directions, and both directions cost
    something: keying on a dot anywhere drops any fact that opens with an
    abbreviation ("Mrs. Beneviento keeps the dolls dressed"), and a dropped
    reveal is a fact the player earned that the narrator never hears about —
