"""The briefing packet schema.

This is the Wall's contract. The GM is constrained to this shape at the
sampling layer via output_config.format, so a malformed packet is not a
failure mode we have to handle — the model physically cannot emit one.

Two shape changes from the original design doc, both forced by the schema
constraints of structured outputs:

  1. Objects keyed by NPC id (npc_direction, psyche_updates) become arrays
     of objects carrying an `npc` field. Structured outputs require
     additionalProperties: false on every object, which rules out
     arbitrary-key maps.

  2. state_updates becomes a flat list of path/op/value edits rather than a
     nested dict to deep-merge. Turned out to be the better design anyway:
     every mutation is individually inspectable and loggable, and there is
     no ambiguity about whether a nested dict replaces or merges.

    Structured outputs demand additionalProperties: false and a complete

    omitted keys.
