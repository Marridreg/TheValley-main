"""The Wall — the turn loop that keeps the two models apart.

Synchronous by design. It runs on a worker thread and reports progress through
an `emit` callback, which is what keeps the UI responsive and lets prose stream
in token by token. The original design ran a fresh asyncio loop inside the
pywebview bridge on every action, which blocks the UI thread for the full
duration of two chained API calls — a dead window for the length of a turn,
with no streaming possible.
