"""Belief resolution and disclosure posture. GM-side only.

The three-tier epistemic stack, resolved lazily:

    tier 3   runtime ledger        state.beliefs — perception updates and
                                   generate-and-commit fills; saves carry it
    tier 2   seed_beliefs          private card, top-level block beside
                                   `sections` — the load-bearing DIVERGENT
                                   beliefs only; where this person departs
                                   from their faction's default
    tier 1   faction chain         data/factions.json — defaults by
                                   population, nearest faction first

Resolution walks 3 -> 2 -> 1 and returns the first hit. A total miss is not
an error; it is the signal to generate-and-commit: the lazy-instantiation
pass writes a new tier-3 entry from the character's card and ledger (never
the vault) and the miss never recurs. A generated belief that happens to be
true is a lucky guess, not a leak — the generator could not see the truth,
and neither can the narrator, so the prose cannot confirm it.

Nothing in this module may be imported by narrator.py. Faction orthodoxies
are honest about what groups collectively know (see the court), which makes
factions.json vault-adjacent. Nothing here crosses the Wall mechanically:
resolved beliefs-plus-postures feed the GM's turn block (gm._belief_block),
and reach the narrator only as the GM chooses to voice them through
npc_direction — gated by reveal_this_turn like any other information.

DIVERGENCE is computed, not authored: a belief diverges when it differs
from what the faction chain alone would have said. That makes the
disclosure math run without anyone hand-marking heresies — and it means a
character can be wrong about the room, because pressure is computed from
who is actually listening, while the character acts on their *beliefs*
about those listeners. Miscalibration is just an inaccurate belief, and
inaccurate beliefs are first-class.
