"""Prove the belief stack resolves. No API key, no network, no cost.

Loads the real factions.json and real character cards, then asserts the
resolution order (ledger -> seed -> chain -> miss), computed divergence, the
parentless exceptions, the unnamed-villager catch-all, and the v1 disclosure
postures — including Anton's doubt, which must be spoken freely alone, held
close at Luiza's hearth, and buried in front of Eugen.
